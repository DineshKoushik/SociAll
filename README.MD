## What We Are About

With there being more and more social media websites that people can interact in, the need to link all of these social media accounts to one location has arisen. SociAll is designed to create this single location so that a person can link all of their social media accounts. Users will be able to create a profile with SociAll where they will be able to link any social media profile that they have. The users will then be able to add a person on all of their linked social media acocunts simply by adding/following someones SociAll account. Future additions may include things like: a QR reader so that people can easily add/follow someone on SociAll, a feature to un-add/un-follow someone on SociAll, a way to view someones linked social media accounts so people like employers could easily see an applicants social medias in one location, and a way to have a social media setting and a business setting for your profile.

You can find access to the corrent build below (there is more to be added)
